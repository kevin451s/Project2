#Project 2
  For my second Project, I will be designing a photo gallery to display photos. Users will be able to sign and browse through photos I have uploaded to a gallery. Users will
  also be able to like and share photos to their friends.

#Technologies
  The programs I will be using to design this app will be:
  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. Ruby
  4. jQuery
